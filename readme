# File Organizer Script made by Python

This Python script is designed to help organize files in a given directory
based on their extensions.
It sorts files into separate folders (e.g., "Images", "Videos", "Documents", etc.)
depending on the file type.

## Features
- Automatically organizes files into categorized folders.
- Supports multiple file types such as images, videos, documents, music, etc.
- Creates necessary folders if they do not exist.
- Skips directories and unsupported file types.

## Libraries Used
The script uses two Python libraries:
- **`os`**: This library provides functions for interacting with the operating system, such as working with files and directories. In this script, `os` is used to:
  - Get the list of files in a directory (`os.listdir()`).
  - Check if a path is a file or a directory (`os.path.isfile()`).
  - Join paths into a single path (`os.path.join()`).
  - Create directories if they do not exist (`os.makedirs()`).

- **`shutil`**: This library offers a high-level interface for file operations. In this script, `shutil` is used to:
  - Move files from one location to another (`shutil.move()`).

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Modify the `directory` variable in the script to the path of the folder you want to organize. For example:
   ```python
   directory = r"C:\...yourFolderPath..."

##Run the script with Python:
bash
Copy code
python file_organizer.py
The script will automatically organize the files based on their extensions:

Images: .jpg, .png, .gif
Videos: .mp4, .mov
Documents: .doc, .pdf, .txt
Music: .mp3, .wav

## Notes
The script ignores subdirectories and only processes files.
If a file has an extension not defined in the script, it will be skipped and a message will be printed.
If a file is already in the correct folder, it will not be moved again.
